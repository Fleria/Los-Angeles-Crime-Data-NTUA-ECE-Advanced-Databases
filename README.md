# AdvancedDatabasesNTUA23
Final project of the course Advanced Databases - 9th semester, Electrical Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens.

Series of queries regarding Big Data on the datasets 'Los Angeles Crime Data', [2010-2010](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-2019) and [2020-2023](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). 
Project runs on Apache Spark over Apache Hadoop Yarn using HDFS. All queries are implemented using Python PySpark.
